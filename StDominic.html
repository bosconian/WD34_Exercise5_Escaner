    If you are fascinated with religious sites, you have to lay your eyes on the Saint Dominic Cathedral. Found at Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, this premier tourist spot was previously named Saint Augustine Church. It envelopes a Baroque architecture and a striking facade that always leaves the devotees in awe. With an octagonal bell tower made out of red bricks, this church remains active today despite being ravished by extreme calamities such as earthquakes and fires. In the past years, reconstructions were only made on the main buildingâ€“its frontage and the bell tower were left untouched, resembling the unwavering faith of the believers in the region. Hence, it is the place to go if you opt to reflect and spend time being grateful for the gift of life bestowed to you by the Creator.
